      <h3>The AudioMemorization program helps you learn texts through listening and prompting.</h3>
        
      <p>Whether you are doing housework, exercise or on your commute, you can listen to the computer generated sound 
        files to help you memorize passages, homework, texts for language learning etc. The text gets split 
        into manageable portions and converted into into natural-sounding speech with audio prompts.

    <br>
    <h3>Psalm 23, Day 1</h3>  
    The Lord is my shepherd, I lack nothing.<br>
    He makes me lie down in green pastures,<br>
    he leads me beside quiet waters,<br>
    he refreshes my soul.<br>
    <hr>
    <strong>1. All the adjectives and nouns get replaced by a ding sound.</strong><br>
    <br>
    The * (Lord) is my * (shepherd), I lack * (nothing).<br> 
    He makes me lie down in * * (green) (pastures),<br> 
    he leads me beside * (quiet) * (waters),<br>
    he refreshes my * (soul).<br>  
    <hr>
    <strong>2. All the verbs get replaced by a ding sound.</strong><br>
    <br>
    The Lord * (is) my shepherd, I * (lack) nothing.<br>
    He * (makes) me * (lie) down in green pastures,<br> 
    he * (leads) me beside quiet waters,<br>
    he * (refreshes) my soul.<br> 
    <hr>
    <strong>3. The first 2 words of each line are spoken, try to remember the rest</strong><br>
    (the answer for each line is given after around 10 seconds)<br>
    <br>
    The Lord ...<br>
    He makes ...<br>
    he leads ...<br> 
    he refreshes ...<br>
    <hr>
    <strong>4. Now remember each line without any hint</strong><br>
    (the answer for each line is given after around 10 seconds)<br>
    <br>
    The Lord is ...<br>
    ....<br>
    ....<br>
    ....<br>
    <hr>
    <strong>5. Finally, you will be asked to say the whole section for day 1.</strong>
    <br><br>
    Psalm 23 is split into 5 days, each day begins with repeating the previous days section<br>
    before continuing  with the new portion. On the final day it goes through each section.
