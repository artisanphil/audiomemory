# AudioMemory

The mp3 files generated by this tool help with learning texts through listening and prompting.

Whether you are doing housework, exercise or on your commute, you can listen to the computer generated sound files to help you memorize passages, homework, texts for language learning etc. The text gets split into manageable portions and converted into natural-sounding speech with audio prompts. 

## Installation

Install Docker

Go to the root of the project and run:

```
docker compose up -d
```

## Generating the mp3 files

Make sure the Docker container is running (see installation).

Add your text to `generate/input.txt`. Add line breaks so that each line is short enough for repetition.

To generate the output run this:

```
docker exec -it audiomemory node generate/index.js 
```
